			<h1>Image Discrète</h1>
				<p>We trained a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on a dataset of CCTV cameras snapshots. Dreamy Cops shows a dystopian journey in the latent space of the network, during which bodies are being formed and deformed. Training has been stopped early, such that output people only appear as fantomatic, shady and almost inhuman. The gradients of light are controlled by the Discriminator that evaluates how close the generated apparitions are to real pedestrians.
</p>
				<p>The aim of Dreamy Cops is twofold. It first depicts the alienation of modern monitoring methods that track population -such as facial recognition, or behavior analysis. The idea here is to transform the technology used to monitor population (convolutional neural networks), and the datasets used to train this monitoring (CCTV cameras snapshots), into an artistic reflexion: the cops (for instance the facial recognition networks) can also be artists (when their technology is used to generate new, dreamy images).
